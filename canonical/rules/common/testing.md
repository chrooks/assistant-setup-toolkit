# Testing

- Test behavior, not implementation.
- Fixing a bug? Write the failing test first — prove it fails, then fix.
- Fix the implementation, not the test — unless the test itself is wrong.
- Keep tests isolated; verify mocks match the real contract.
- Coverage follows risk: core logic gets real tests; trivial one-liners need none.
- Route test-first feature work through the `/tdd` skill.

## Test Structure (AAA Pattern)

Prefer Arrange-Act-Assert structure for tests:

```typescript
test('calculates similarity correctly', () => {
  // Arrange
  const vector1 = [1, 0, 0]
  const vector2 = [0, 1, 0]

  // Act
  const similarity = calculateCosineSimilarity(vector1, vector2)

  // Assert
  expect(similarity).toBe(0)
})
```

### Test Naming

Use descriptive names that explain the behavior under test:

```typescript
test('returns empty array when no markets match query', () => {})
test('throws error when API key is missing', () => {})
test('falls back to substring search when Redis is unavailable', () => {})
```
