/* Stop hook: block a session from ending with an uncommitted record.
 *
 * The chat leak: work done in a session that never reaches the ledgers.
 * Mirrors chrooked-pokedex/scripts/hooks/deploy-owed-stop.js.
 *
 * - Truth is `git status --porcelain`: modified, staged, and untracked files
 *   that are not ignored. Hand edits synced in by LiveSync count too; they are
 *   part of the record and get committed with an honest message.
 * - Yields after one block (stop_hook_active) so it cannot trap the session.
 * - Escape: Claude names the pending log in its report and says why.
